#### Tested in python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8

A reddit bot template in python, using praw.  

---------


### To use:
You need to have your own Reddit api credentials. If you do not head [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps "reddit apps") and click create application -> script.  
**Add what is needed to botinfo.example.py then rename it to botinfo.py. If you do not fill all the info in then the script will not work.**  
Currently recommended that you enter the credentials in database via the cli. However it is good to start with the credentials in the botinfo.py because the cli will import them for you  
Fully tested releases are [here](https://github.com/Cyb3r-Jak3/useful_bot/releases "useful bot releases")  

``` 
pip install praw  
git clone https://github.com/Cyb3r-Jak3/useful_bot.git  
```

To run:  
```    
python3 main.py
```
or
```
python3 cli.py
```
If you want to import the credentials for easier use:
```
python3.6 cli.py import
```
**To get any responses to messages, posts or comments you have to use the response add feature in the cli.**  
To get multiple subreddit use the cli change subreddit and for the new subreddit do "subreddit1+subreddit2+etc"
